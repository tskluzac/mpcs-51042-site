We are more than happy to find ways to provide additional flexibility in these situations. Ideally, you should notify us of these circumstances before the work is due so we can discuss options with you.</p> <p>In other words, the late submission policy applies to ordinary circumstances: if you are having a busy week, you have an event that overlaps with a deadline, etc., then the grading scheme will have some built-in flexibility for this. Instead of trying to argue for a few extra days to work on an assignment, you should just submit the work you have completed by the deadline, so you can get feedback on that work and use that feedback to improve your work in future assignments, or even to resubmit the assignment as described above.</p>"},{"location":"coursework/programming/#grading-disputes","title":"Grading Disputes","text":"<p>Except in very specific cases (described below), you cannot dispute the score assigned to you on a piece of work. The score you receive on a piece of work is meant to convey feedback on your level of mastery, and you should take it as an opportunity to understand the areas of improvement in your work. You are more than welcome to ask us for concrete advice on how to improve your work, and we are always more than happy to have those kind of conversations with students, including going over your code. On the other hand, we will not entertain requests to change your score just because you feel your work deserved a higher score.</p> <p>There is one exception to this: if a grader made an factual mistake in your grading. Please note that this only includes cases where a grader makes an erroneous statement about your code in their feedback. It does not include cases where you simply disagree with whether something deserves to be flagged as incorrect.</p> <p>For example, suppose you receive a piece of feedback that says \u201cIncorrect: Function X did not check that parameter Y is greater than zero\u201d. If function X in your code did perform this check, and the grader missed this fact (and erroneously gave you that feedback), you can ask us to review this decision. Please note that, even if the feedback is amended, it may not affect your actual SNU score.</p> <p>We ask that you keep these requests brief and to the point: no more than a few sentences identifying the exact statement that the grader made and the reasons you believe the statement was mistaken, including references to specific parts of your code (e.g., \u201cI did check the value of the parameter in line 107\u201d). Focus on laying out the facts, and nothing else.</p> <p>Finally, it is also your responsibility to make these requests in a timely manner. Requests to review grading mistakes must be submitted no later than one week after a graded piece of work is returned to you. After that time, we will not consider any such requests, regardless of whether the request is reasonable and justified.</p> <p>Disputes should be submitted via the Regrade Request mechanism of Gradescope.</p>"},{"location":"coursework/programming/#code-quality-efficiency","title":"Code Quality &amp; Efficiency","text":"<p>Producing code that solves a problem is only part of the task, that code needs to be intelligible to your fellow developer and/or future self.
